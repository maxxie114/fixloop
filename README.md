# FixLoop: Autonomous Recovery Validation

FixLoop is an enterprise-grade autonomous recovery validation platform. It bridge the gap between **Observability** (detecting a problem) and **Resolution** (confirming a fix) by using AI to orchestrate the entire incident lifecycle.

## 🚀 The Vision
When production breaks, you don't just need an alert; you need a **verification plan**. FixLoop detects incidents via Datadog, generates targeted tests using **MiniMax M2.5**, executes them automatically, and confirms recovery—eliminating human uncertainty in the heat of an outage.

## 🛠 How It Works

### 1. Incident Feed (Powered by Datadog)
The **Incident Feed** on the left is the heartbeat of the application. 
- **Data Source**: It doesn't just "guess"; it queries real-time metrics from the **Datadog API**.
- **The Signal**: When your service error rate spikes or latency climbs, FixLoop ingests the "Datadog Signal," including the specific error message and service ID.
- **Direct Link**: Every incident includes a deep link to the **Datadog Metric Explorer**, allowing you to see the raw telemetry behind the detection.

### 2. Recovery Validation Plan (Generated by MiniMax M2.5)
Once an incident is detected, the **AI Orchestrator** goes to work.
- **Dynamic Planning**: Instead of using static scripts, we send the incident context (service name, error type, metrics) to the **MiniMax M2.5** model.
- **The Result**: The AI generates a custom, 5-step validation plan designed specifically to test the failure point. These are the items you see in the "Recovery Validation Plan" section.

### 3. Automated Validation (The Test Engine)
The **Test Results** section on the right shows the live execution of the validation plan.
- **Black-Box Testing**: Our backend executes real HTTP/API tests against your production-like environment.
- **Logic**: Tests are designed to verify both the **presence of the bug** (confirming the incident is real) and the **success of the fix** (confirming the system has recovered).

### 4. Ask FixLoop (AI Copilot)
The sidebar is your **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Partner**, powered by **MiniMax M2.5**.
- **Context Awareness**: The chatbot knows exactly which incident you are looking at and has access to the Datadog logs and test results.
- **RAG Integration**: It doesn't just hallucinate; it uses the real system state to answer questions like *"What caused this?"* or *"Is it safe to resume traffic?"*

## 🏆 Hackathon Highlights
- **Real Round-Trip**: The first dashboard that uses real Datadog metrics to trigger an AI agent.
- **Zero-Trust Recovery**: Don't just trust a "Healthy" status; prove it worth with automated tests.
- **Premium UX**: A "Glassmorphism" design that makes infrastructure monitoring feel like a flight cockpit.
